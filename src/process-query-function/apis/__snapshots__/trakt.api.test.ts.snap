Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over a hundred years, until one day, a Colossal Titan appears out of thin air and destroys part of the city wall. As teenage boy, Eren Jaeger, and his foster sister, Mikasa Ackerman, witness the destruction of their town and death of their mother at the hands of the Titans, Eren vows to kill every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

The Pair consists of two 17-year-old junior level 'Trouble Consultants', a cross between a trouble-shooter and a secret agent. They work for an organization called World Welfare & Works Association or the 3WA which handles problems galaxy-wide. Their codename is 'Lovely Angels' but it's easy to see why they are eventually known as the Dirty Pair, not in a naughty way, but because they tend to leave ruination wherever they go. Yuri is the purple-haired and perky team member, she is occasionally zany and a bit distracted. Yuri tends to rely on her feminine wiles to get out of trouble, rarely plans ahead and is obsessed wit",
