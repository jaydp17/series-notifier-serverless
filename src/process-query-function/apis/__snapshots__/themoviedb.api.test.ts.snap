Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like an unseen guardian angel.

Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and dedicates his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is literally the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become...The Flash.",
